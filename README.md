## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Libraries used found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. This code works with Python version 3.

## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
Analyze, model, and visualize four questions related to Boston AirBNB listing data:
1. Is there high or low variance between the mean price per bedroom/bathroom and observed list prices (entire units only)?
2. As the number of bedrooms increase does list price increase? What about number of bathrooms (entire units only)?
3. Can we provide Airbnb owners typical rental prices in different Boston neighborhoods? 
4. Can we provide Boston Airbnb owners feedback on rental type demand (IE, are rooms/shared rooms/full units in higher demand)?
